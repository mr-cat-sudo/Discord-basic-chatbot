# Discord-basic-chatbot
# STEPS TO INSTALL
1. create a .env file/enviormental secret called "TOKEN" and add your token to it
2. If you want, create a keep_alive so your bot runs 24/7, if you want to know how to do that just join the discord or dm aa124231231#2788 (average response time 7 hours)
3. to run the bot run "node index.js", this just means running the main file. (with python you would do python main.py or something like that)
4. DO NOT CLAIM THIS CODE AS YOUR OWN, OR I GO GOD MODE
